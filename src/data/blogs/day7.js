        "Biking around Burnham Park was one of the most relaxing and enjoyable parts of my visit to Baguio. As soon as I got there, I rented a bike from one of the stalls lined up near the biking area—there were so many types to choose from, including tandem and colorful kiddie bikes. I went with a classic single-seater and spent the next hour cruising through the designated bike paths that loop around the park. The cool Baguio breeze, the view of the pine trees, and the cheerful atmosphere made it such a peaceful experience. It felt great to just ride and take in the surroundings at my own pace, away from the rush of the city.",
        "After our leisure time at Burnham Park, we grab a lunch back at the Hotel and prepared for Baguio departure. It is once again time to return. "

        "The entire tour was truly a memorable experience, filled with new learnings, meaningful moments, and unforgettable adventures. Among all the places we visited, our time in Baguio stood out the most—the cool breeze, the peaceful atmosphere, and the beautiful scenery made it feel like a world of its own. From biking in Burnham Park to picking strawberries and visiting cultural landmarks, every moment felt special. As we prepare to return home, we carry with us not just photos and souvenirs, but memories that will stay with us for a lifetime."
